### Exploring the OpenGL API, in the context of visualizing higher dimensional data, using General Line Coordinates (GLC).

I've implemented a 2-D vector class (GLvec2) in order to experiment with using vectors in the context of computer graphics.
So far, this has amounted to designing a drawArrow class, which is to say a GL_LINE_STRIP consisting of two points with a GL_TRIANGLE
at its endpoint.

I've implemented the GLC (General Line Coordinate) visualization methods of PC (Parallel Coordinates), Shifted PC, and Scaled PC.
Currently working on implementing the Radial Coordinate GLC visualization method.
